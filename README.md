## Introduction

We are two students of Computer Engineering in their last year of degree. We wanted to relax ourself and do a simple App but 
also a cool and funny one. Then we tought about making an App for our smartphones and learning another leanguage.
Finally, we wanted to touch some IA or face detection so our idea was set, making an App to detect faces and change it to 
other faces. We can learn Kotlin, touch IA and face detection and make a simple but a cool APP. 
The last key was with whom change faces and we agreed that we wanted the coolest actor, Nicolas Cage.

## How it Works

We use an imageview that allows us to put an image picking it in the gallery or making a potho. When you picked the photo then using the
"Transform into Nicolas" button we take the image from the imageview and then we use the firebase api in order to use face detection. 
We detect the face of all the people and change it to Nicolas Cage face in order to win Swag. 
Thanks to the firebase api we can detect the %smiling, %eyerigthopen, %eyeleftopen, rotations ...
Thanks to this API we are able to modify the image and then saving into the gallery and sending to our friends.
